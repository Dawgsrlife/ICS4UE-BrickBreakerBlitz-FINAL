 * It represents the bricks in the game
 * It contains state variables for the its coordinates and its health,
 * and has a method to lower its health or destroy itself that is called whenever a ball collides with the brick
 * Furthermore, it provides methods to change the direction of the ball
 * when it collides with a paddle/wall/brick, etc.
